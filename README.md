## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using Random Forest Techniques for Heart Disease Prediction System.

- What is the background of your project?

Heart disease is a leading cause of premature death in the world.Predicting the outcome of disease is the challenging task.Data mining is involved to automatically infer diagnostic rules and help specialists to make diagnosis process more reliable.Several data mining techniques are used by researchers to help health care professionals to predict the heart disease.Random forest is an ensemble and most accurate learning algorithm,suitable for medical applications.

- Business Problem Statement:

In this paper ,I  propose a classification model which uses random forest as classifier to predict heart disease. The experimental results have shown that my approach improves classification accuracy compared to other classification approaches,and the presented model can be successfully used by health care professional for predicting heart disease.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The data given to us by Upgrad.
